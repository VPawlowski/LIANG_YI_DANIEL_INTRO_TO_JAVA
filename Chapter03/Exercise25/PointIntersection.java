/* Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), as shown in Figure
3.8a and b. The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear equations:

    (y1 - y2) * x - (x1 - x2) * y = (y1 - y2) * x1 - (x1 - x2) * y1
    (y3 - y4) * x - (x3 - x4) * y = (y3 - y4) * x3 - (x3 - x4) * y3

This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming Exercise 3.3). If the equation has no solutions,
the two lines are parallel (see Figure 3.8c). Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays
the intersecting point. */
