/* Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is:

    h = (q + (26(m + 1) / 10) + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + 5j) % 7

Where h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, and 6: Friday).
q is the day of the month.
m is the month (3: March, 4: April, . . ., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the
previous year.
j is (year / 100)
k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).

Note all divisions in this exercise perform an integer division. Write a program that
prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month.

(Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need to convert the user input 1 to 13 and
2 to 14 for the month and change the year to the previous year. For example, if the user enters 1 for m and 2015 for
year, m will be 13 and year will be 2014 used in the formula.) */
