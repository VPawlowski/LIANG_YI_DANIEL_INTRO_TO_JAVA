# LIANG_Y_DANIEL_INTRO_TO_JAVA

This repository serves to document my learning process of programming with the help of Liang Y. Daniel's 
"Introduction to Java Programming and Date Structures - Comprehensive Version (11th Edition)".

If you notice any mistakes, or wish to offer advice to a developping programmer - feel free to post an issue, I would highly appreciate the help!
